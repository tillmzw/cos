## Recovery

With most everyone retreating inside the city walls to recover, {{% mdref thaddeus %}} stays back with a few inhabitants to repair the damage to the wall done by the tree-like creature. While doing that, he eventually is approached by {{% mdref Izek %}}, asking if he knew anything about the magic used during {{% mdref 12-shadow-over-the-festival "the festival" %}}. Expecting to be on the good side of the {{% mdref vargas-vallakovich "Baron" %}}, he tries to barter with {{% mdref Izek %}} for an audience with the {{% mdref vargas-vallakovich "Baron" %}} himself, in exchange for information about what transpired during the festival.

After everyone has gathered back at the inn, {{% mdref reese %}}, {{% mdref ilizeiros %}}, and {{% mdref thaddeus %}} carefully make acquaintance with the mysterious {{% mdref yaroslav %}}. He appears to also be here because of some Vistani prophecy. {{% mdref yaroslav %}} also wants to reach out to the local church's priest to inquire about some relics.

When the party enters the church, {{% mdref thaddeus %}} and {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} go on to inform {{% mdref ireena-kolyana "Ireena" %}} about the fate of {{% mdref barovia %}}, while {{% mdref yaroslav %}} and {{% mdref reese %}} approach {{% mdref father-petrovich %}} to find out about the state of the holy relics of {{% mdref barovia %}}.

## Refugees

{{% mdref ireena-kolyana "Ireena" %}}, shaken by the news of {{% mdref barovia %}} being leveled and her adopted family being dead, is driven by the need to talk to and help the refugees. As she, accompanied by {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} and {{% mdref thaddeus %}}, engages with the refugees camping outside the city walls, the refugees tell stories of being overrun by zombies (some of them even crawling out of wells). They had no chance of survival except fleeing towards the next best safe haven, which they thought would be {{% mdref vallaki %}}. As it turns out, no refugees are allowed inside the city at this time...

Another group of refugees keeps a little further from the city walls around a cart, operated by an older lady called Boninka. She gives away pies to help the refugees, as she herself comes from {{% mdref barovia %}}. Apparently, she does not want to be close to {{% mdref vallaki %}} because she was thrown out of the city by **{{% mdref claudia-blasko %}}** and the {{% mdref vargas-vallakovich "Baron" %}} after she protested the abuse of children in {{% mdref vallaki %}}'s orphanage.

{{% mdref ireena-kolyana "Ireena" %}} promises to make the {{% mdref vargas-vallakovich "Baron" %}} change his mind regarding the refugees not being allowed in {{% mdref vallaki %}}; {{% mdref thaddeus %}} and {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} promise to help her and intend to find out what is going on in the local orphanage.

## Hallowed Bones

{{% mdref father-petrovich %}} is visibly surprised about someone asking about the whereabouts of the church's holy relics; he insists that nobody knows about them except him and the altar boy **Ieska** who periodically cleans the basement; it appears the Vistani prophecies are not part of his ideology.

As he shows {{% mdref yaroslav %}} and {{% mdref reese %}} the way to the relics storage place, he realizes with shock that they have been stolen! After mumbling for a minute, he explains the gravity of the situation: the holy bones of Saint Andrew were exerting an effect on the church and the surrounding {{% mdref vallaki %}} that kept it safe from evil influences. {{% mdref yaroslav %}} barely manages to convince him that telling the populace immediately about the disappearance of the only things they thought kept the place safe would be a bad idea. {{% mdref father-petrovich %}} promises to wait, but he forewarns that the truth will surface sooner rather than later.

Immediately, {{% mdref yaroslav %}} and {{% mdref reese %}} suspect the altar boy Ieska, who is easily found outside the crypt scrubbing the church's floors. Pressing information out of him turns out to be unconventional - he is both deaf and mute. After a little gesticulation, {{% mdref reese %}} takes over and engages his telepathic mind-probing abilities. He finally concludes that while Ieska himself appears innocent, he has shown the basement (for some unknown reason) to another boy working at the church: **Milivo≈°**. According to {{% mdref father-petrovich %}}, he usually tends the church's garden and lives in the orphanage.

## A Common Peculiarity

With {{% mdref yaroslav %}} and {{% mdref reese %}} rushing towards the orphanage, they encounter {{% mdref ireena-kolyana "Ireena" %}}, {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} and {{% mdref thaddeus %}} on their way to the {{% mdref vargas-vallakovich "Baron" %}}. Convinced by the urgency of {{% mdref yaroslav %}} wanting to investigate the orphanage, {{% mdref thaddeus %}} and {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} delay {{% mdref ireena-kolyana "Ireena" %}} on her way to the {{% mdref vargas-vallakovich "Baron" %}} - while she will wait for the party's support to convince the {{% mdref vargas-vallakovich "Baron" %}}, she warns she will confront him before the day is over so the refugees can stay the night inside the city walls.

As they knock on the front doors of the orphanage, an older woman opens the door and introduces herself as {{% mdref claudia-blasko %}}.
