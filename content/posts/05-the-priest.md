## Escape from Durst Manor

The party runs for their lives. First they open the portcullis to the room where they killed the monstrosity thanks to the help of the magic of the artificer [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}).

### The Burgomaster's Funeral

A chilling scene unfolded at the burgomaster's funeral. A carriage, drawn by skeletal horses, arrived, and a tall, slender figure emerged. Irina, stunned by the apparition, watched as the priest clutched his holy symbol. Ismark, the burgomaster's son, demanded that the stranger leave, declaring the funeral a private affair.
The mysterious figure introduced himself as Rahadin, chamberlain to the infamous Lord Strahd. He lays down a flower on the old Burgomasters grace and mentiones to Ismark, that he hopes, that as the new Burgomaster he will do better work than his father. 
After being questioned, what was wrong with the old Burgomaster, Rahadin revealed a disturbing truth: villagers had been vanishing, their bodies found mutilated by claw and bite marks.

### Investigations In Barovia

The funeral concluded abruptly, and the group, including Irina and Ismark, returned to the manor. Ismark explained that the victims had been attacked by a monstrous creature, leaving behind bite and claw marks. The latest victim was Gregor Stanovich. He also revealed that the gypsies, which brough the group here were called Vistani, a nomadic tribe who were the only ones capable of leaving Barovia.
The group learned that Lord Strahd was a vampire, a creature of darkness with a thirst for blood. Ismark tasked them with escorting Irina to Vallaki, a village one day northwest of Borovia.
Before their departure, the group decided to return the dog named Lancelot to its owner. They arrived at the "Whining House," a dilapidated building inhabited by a distraught old woman. She claimed that her daughter, Gertruda, had vanished, and she had seen a dark figure dragging bodies through the night. After some persuasion, she handed over a strange doll with a cryptic inscription:

*"Is no fun, is no Blinsky"*

Determined to find Gertruda and uncover the mystery of the missing villagers, the group investigated Gregor Stanovich's abandoned house. They discovered a silver necklace with a religious symbol, suggesting a violent struggle.
Seeking answers, the group visited a local tavern, where they encountered a trio of Vistani. The Vistani were unable to provide specific information but suggested that Madame Eva, a wise woman living outside of Barovia, might be able to help with the question, how the group got to Borovia in the first plave.

### Return To The Church

After a visit to the burgomaster's manor, the group learned that the silver necklace belonged to Father Donovic. They confronted the priest at the church, but he attempted to flee. After a tense interrogation, he confessed that his son, a monstrous creature, required a steady supply of food. 
The group therefore assumes, that he killed the villagers
The group, horrified by the priest's confession, searched the church for the source of the whispers. They discovered a hidden chamber, where a gaunt, skeletal figure stays motionless in the corner. After some prodding, something attacks Reese and the group readied themselves for battle.
