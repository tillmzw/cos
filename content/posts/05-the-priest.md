## The Burgomaster's Funeral

A chilling scene unfolded at the burgomaster's funeral. A carriage, drawn by skeletal horses, arrived, and a tall, slender figure emerged. [Ireena]({{< ref "ireena-kolyana" >}}), stunned by the apparition, watched as  [Father Donavich]({{< ref "father-donavich" >}}) clutched his holy symbol. [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}), the burgomaster's son, demanded that the stranger leave, declaring the funeral a private affair.
The mysterious figure introduced himself as Rahadin, chamberlain to the infamous [Lord Strahd]({{< ref "strahd-of-zarovich" >}}). He lays down a flower on the old Burgomasters grace and mentiones to [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}), that he hopes, that as the new Burgomaster he will do better work than his father. 
After being questioned, what was wrong with the old Burgomaster, Rahadin revealed a disturbing truth: villagers had been vanishing, their bodies found mutilated by claw and bite marks.

## Investigations In Barovia

The funeral concluded abruptly, and the group, including [Ireena]({{< ref "ireena-kolyana" >}}) and [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}), returned to the manor. [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) explained that the victims had been attacked by a monstrous creature, leaving behind bite and claw marks. The latest victim was Gregor Stanovich. He also revealed that the gypsies, which brought the group here were called Vistani, a nomadic tribe who were the only ones capable of leaving [Barovia]({{< ref "barovia" >}}).
The group learned that [Lord Strahd]({{< ref "strahd-of-zarovich" >}}) was a vampire, a creature of darkness with a thirst for blood. [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) tasked them with escorting [Ireena]({{< ref "ireena-kolyana" >}}) to [Vallaki]({{< ref "vallaki" >}}), a village one day northwest of [Barovia]({{< ref "barovia" >}}).
Before their departure, the group decided to return the dog named Lancelot to its owner. They arrived at the "Whining House," a dilapidated building inhabited by a distraught old woman, in the village referred to as [Mad Mary]({{< ref "mad-mary" >}}). She claimed that her daughter, Gertruda, had vanished, and she had seen a dark figure dragging bodies through the night. After some persuasion, she handed over a strange doll belonging to her daughter with a cryptic inscription:

*"Is no fun, is no Blinsky"*

Determined to find Gertruda and uncover the mystery of the missing villagers, the group investigated Gregor Stanovich's abandoned house. They discovered a silver necklace with a religious symbol, suggesting a violent struggle.
Seeking answers, the group visited a local tavern, where they encountered a trio of Vistani. The Vistani were unable to provide specific information but suggested that Madame Eva, a wise woman living outside of [Barovia]({{< ref "barovia" >}}), might be able to help with the question, how the group got to [Barovia]({{< ref "barovia" >}}) in the first plave.

## Return To The Church

After a visit to the burgomaster's manor, the group learned that the silver necklace belonged to [Father Donavich]({{< ref "father-donavich" >}}). They confronted the priest at the church, but he attempted to flee. After a tense interrogation, he confessed that his son, a monstrous creature, required a steady supply of food. 
The group therefore assumes, that he abducted and killed the villagers. All the while during the interrogation, desperate cries were heard: "*Father, I'm hungry!*"
The group, horrified by the priest's confession, searched the church for the source of the cries. They discovered a hidden chamber below the church, where a gaunt, skeletal figure stays motionless in the corner. After some prodding of the figure, its head tilted back and it became apparent that this figures is not the monstrous son, but one of his dead victims. At that exact moment, something attacked Reese and the group readied themselves for battle.
