description: "The party finally enters Krezk and its abbey. Strange things are going on."
---

Thanks to the fact that they are carrying a werewolf head the party is allowed to enter Krezk. The inside of the Town looks very strange. There is a wood inside the tall walls and only a few scattered buildings. Every building has its own cementary. There is a pool, the burgomasters house, a shrine and on a hill within the town there is the abbey.

The party talks for a while with {{% mdref Ezmeralda %}} and learns that she has a mentor: a legendary monster hunter call Van Richten. After that they ascend the hill to the abbey. Its guarded by to strange humanoid creatures who are half human - half animal. They have various animal parts all across their bodies.

They enter the abbey and in the courtyard they see a half-bat creature chained up. Otherwise the courtyard is empty except for a large amount of scarecrows which look like guards from afar but don't move (for now). They ignore the creature and the scarecrows and enter the big main hall. {{% mdref Ezmeralda %}} goes to the library where she wants to research more on Strahd who she wants to kill. In the big main hall music is playing and there is a gold disc in the center of the room. {{% mdref Yaroslav %}} says a prayer. 

The abbott "Abbs" is waiting for them. He turns out to be very strange and is talking to a woman. The party approaches him and notices that he is not a normal abbott. The woman is even worse. She has been "built" by the abbott as a bride for Strahd but still lacks a face. 

By looking closer they notice that she is constructed from various body parts. The abbott seems to be engaging i a weird form of necromancy. {{% mdref Reese %}} tries to communicate telepathically with her but to no avail. "Abbs" ask for Ireenas face. The party declines. 

The party leaves the main hall and sneaks through the abbey to the library to join {{% mdref Ezmeralda %}} again. There is screaming in the courtyard. She is unfazed by the news about Abbs and just confirms that the abbott is very strange. {{% mdref Thaddeus %}} climbs to the tower with the abbott and learns about constructing bodies. 

After that the party leaves the abbey and and searches for a places out in the open to sleep. They are woken in the middle of the night by knocking on the town gates.
