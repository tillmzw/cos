## Meeting up at the church

Its an especially foggy and windy day in Vallaki.

The party arrives at the church and briefs {{% mdref father-petrovich %}}. They all try to figure out whats going on. Why did {{% mdref izek %}} kidnap {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}}? Whats up with the dolls? They don't arrive at a conclusion.

Meanwhile {{% mdref reese %}} is staying at the Blue Water Inn. He overhears that the guards will be locking down the city and search every house for the missing {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}}. As soon as the shady {{% mdref rictavio %}} hears this, he disappears to his room.

## Leaving Vallaki

Reese goes to the church and warns the party. They decide to leave the city. They climb over the walls and follow the woods edge and leave towards {{% mdref Kresk %}}. Due to the fog the guards don't see them. On the road they are ambushed by a pack of wolves lead by an large wolf. The party kills the wolves but not before the Monk {{% mdref yaroslav %}} is knocked unconscious.

## Arriving in Kresk

The party arrives at {{% mdref Kresk %}} carrying the unconscious Yaroslav. The town is surrounded by high sturdy walls an located at the foot of hills. The top of the trees are covered by snow. The fur hat wearing guards will not let them enter. The party pleads with them and they fetch the Burgomaster of {{% mdref Kresk %}}. He tells them that they have a werewolf problem. If they solve it, they will be allowed to enter. The party sleeps beneath the walls to recover before facing the vampires. During the night they manage to deciffer a further part of Strahds journal. It deals with a wizard who lives in a tower close to Lake Zarovich. Strahd apparently wanted to learn magic from the Wizard to escape Barovia. So apparently he is trapped here as well.

The party leaves towards the north east of the city and while walking along a river is ambushed by naked berserkers. They manage to kill them all. Including one of them who tries to flee.
