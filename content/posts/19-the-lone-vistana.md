description: "On a daring hunt for werewolves, the party encounters unexpected but much needed help."
---

Still confounded by the task to hunt werewolves, the party pushes on through the woods east of {{% mdref Kresk %}}. Getting closer to the rough area where the werewolves supposedly live, {{% mdref Yaroslav %}} - having sprung a trap - suddenly jumps out of the way, while {{% mdref Thaddeus %}} gets caught in a net falling from the treetops. With {{% mdref Thaddeus %}} still hopelessly struggling, a woman swings down from above: she is clad in colorful clothing, has one prosthetic leg and long, curly black hair. She introduces herself as {{% mdref Esmeralda %}} and explains that she has been waiting in ambush for werewolves with her silvered net. She further remarks that the werewolf pack is too dangerous for the party. Since it is assumed that the city guards of {{% mdref Kresk %}} can't tell one wolf head from another, the party decides to lure a few werewolves into the net.

While this doesn't turn out quite as expected, the party kills one and captures another werewolf after {{% mdref Yaroslav %}} stunned it and {{% mdref Esmeralda %}} threw her net over it. The killed one transformed from a rather inconspicuous wolf into a fearsome hybrid when engaged, and after capture the (as it turns out, female) werewolf transforms back to a human form, pleading for her life. {{% mdref Esmeralda %}} interrogates her; apparently some **Kyril** is the leader of the pack of "dozens" of werewolves, which lives in a cave in the nearby hills, with an entrance roughly shaped like a wolf's head. Interestingly, she says that she originally came from a settlement close to Daggerfall, but was abducted as a child - she doesn't remember how long ago that was. She might have suffered the same fate as the party: was she transported here against her will?

{{% mdref Ilizeiros %}} beheads the first[^1] and {{% mdref Esmeralda %}} kills the other werewolf against her desperate pleas for mercy.

Together with {{% mdref Esmeralda %}} - who apparently is owed a favor by one city guard of {{% mdref Kresk %}}, potentially making entry easier - the group heads back towards {{% mdref Kresk %}}, with a werewolf's head to gain entry into the city.
