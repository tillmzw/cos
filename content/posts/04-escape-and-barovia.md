## Escape from Durst Manor

The party runs for their lives. First they open the portcullis to the room where they killed the monstrosity thanks to the help of the magic of the artificer [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}).

They also encounter spiders attacking them with webs which [Ilizeiros]({{< ref "ilizeiros" >}}) luckily manages to burn.

Then they go upstairs where they see a group of ghosts reenacting the birth of Walther. The door to the balcony from this room is blocked by scythes.

The scythes swing back and forth in the rythm of the contraptions of what the party identifies as ghost Lady Durst.

By reanimating the corpse of real baby Walther the party distracts the ghosts and the scythes swing back and forth much slower.

The party manages to escape to the balcony, which appears to be above a cliff 1000 feet tall. Luckily [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) can cast the magical spell feather fall which allows the party to jump down.

They land and see the doors to the estate closing. The run and manage to escape the compound in the last moment. Behind them the manor is swallowed by the earth.

## Entering Barovia

The party is passed by a hearse, that leaves behind food.

The party eats it despite slight reservations and while eating they see a village in the distance through the fog.

They walk for half an hour before reaching the village. While walking they notice that the stuff they took from the mansion is aging fast but remains usable. They enter the village and its a depressing sight. Half the houses seem to be empty and many windows are boarded up.

They arrive at the center of the village where there is a shop and a tavern.

The tavern is called the "Blood on the Vine". There they meet the barkeeper Arik and order some food and wine. They are joined by [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) "the Lesser" who is mocked by the three owners of the tavern Alenka, Mirabell and Sorvia.

[Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) explains some things to the party: They are in the village of [Barovia]({{< ref "barovia" >}}) in the land of Barovia. He confirms the location of the land as on the sword coast and the year as the current year. [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) is the new Burgomeister of the village. His father Kolyan - the old Burgomeister - has died a few days ago.

He needs help burying him.

Another problem is that the mysterious lord of the land (Lord Strahd) has taken an interest in the adopted stepsister of [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) - [Ireena]({{< ref "ireena-kolyana" >}}).

Apparently he talked to her multiple nights and the manor of the Burgomeister was attacked in these nights by unknown creatures.

[Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) invites the party to his manor but the party prefers to sleep in the inn and promises him to visit [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) the following morning.

Before going to bed, the party goes to the shop and discovers that all the goods are ourageously expsensive.

Only [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) buys a wetstone and starts working on a set of wooden alchemist tools.

## The Burgomeisters task

The next morning the group travels to the Burgomeisters mansion. It clearly has been attacked by wolf-like creatures. There are claw-marks on the outside of the building.

[Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) and his very beautiful red haired sister [Ireena]({{< ref "ireena-kolyana" >}}) are there together with the body of their father. [Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) wants to get [Ireena]({{< ref "ireena-kolyana" >}}) to safety. He suggests the neighbouring town of [Vallaki]({{< ref "vallaki" >}}). She however doesn't want to leave without having buried her father.

The party and the two carry the coffin to the church north of the village.

While climbing the small hill part of the fog lifts and they see a mighty castle further north of the village on a cliff above a forest.

[Ismark]({{< ref "ismark-kolyanovich" >}}) explains to them that this is the castle Ravenloft.

There are many freshly dug graves despite there not having been burial ceremonies for a while

They meet the priest of the church - [Father Donavich]({{< ref "father-donavich" >}}) - and he explains to them that some people have been buried without ceremony.

When they start burying Kolina, a black carriage arrives pulled by skeletal horses.

A tall creature with pointy ears exits the carriages and walks towards the party.
