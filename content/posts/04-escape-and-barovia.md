## Escape from Durst Manor

The party runs for their lives. First they open the portcullis to the room where they killed the monstrosity thanks to the help of the magic of the artificer Thaddeus.

Then they go upstairs where they see a group of ghosts reenacting the birth of Walther. The door to the balcony from this room is blocked by scythes.

The scythes swing back and forth in the rythm of the contraptions of the ghost Lady Durst.

By reanimating the corpse of Walther the party distracts the ghosts and the scythes swing back and forth much slower.

The party manages to escape to the balcony. The balcony appears to be above a cliff 1000 feet tall. Luckily Reese can cast the magical spell feather fall which allows the party to jump down.

They land and see the doors to the estate closing. The run and manage to escape the compound in the last moment. Behind them the manor is swallowed by the earth.

## Entering Barovia

The party is passed by a hearse who leaves behind food.

The party eats it despite slight reservations and sees a village in the distance.

They walk for half an hour and enter the village. Its a depressing sight. Half the houses seem to be empty and many windows are boarded up.

They arrive at the center of the village where there is a shop and a tavern.

In the tavern called the blood on the vine they meet Ismark the lesser who asks them to join him and explains some things to the party.

They are in the village of Barovia in the land of Barovia.

Ismark is the son of the Burgomeister of the village. His father Kolina has died.

He needs help burying him.

Another problem is that the mysterious lord of the land (Lord Strahd) has taken an interest in the sister of Ismark - Irina.

Apparently he talked to her multiple nights and the manor of the Burgomeister was attacked in these nights by unknown creatures.

Ismark invites the party to his manor but the party prefers to sleep in the inn and promises him to visit Ismark.

Before going to bed, the party goes to the shop and discovers that all the goods are ourageously expsensive.

Only Thaddeus buys some tools.

## The Burgomeisters task

The next morning the group travels to the Burgomeisters mansion. It clearly has been attacked by wolf-like creatures. There are claw-marks on the outside of the building.

Ismark and his very beautiful sister Irina are there together with the body of their father. Ismark wants to get Irina to safety. He suggests the neighbouring town of Vallakia. She however doesn't want to leave without having buried her father.

The party and the two carry the coffin to the church north of the village.

While climbing the small hill part of the fog lifts and they see a mighty castle further north of the village on a cliff above a forrest.

Ismark explains to them that this is the castle Ravenloft.

There are many freshly dug grave despite there not having been burial ceremonies for a while

They meet the priest of the chruch - Fathe Donavich and he explains to them that some people have been buried without ceremony.

When they start burying Kolina, a dark carriage arrives.

A tall creature with pointy ears exits the carriages and walks towards the party.
