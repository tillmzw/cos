## Road to the Castle

Continuing towards the fabled Argynvostholt, the supposed resting place of a powerful dragon, the party has to cross the westward bridge again. Using the tried-and-true strategy of hiding from the otherworldly horse rider gallopping over the bridge, the party crosses unharmed.

Finally arriving at the described location, the party finds a large abandoned castle that appears to have served a military purpose in days long gone. A dragon statue (which Thaddeus finds is likely a silver dragon) looms in front of the castle entry, over which the name **ARGYNVOSTHOLT** is engraved. Passing the dragon springs a trap - luckily that trap appears to have lost most of its power and exhales not icy but just cold winds.

## Investigating the Castle

Wary of traps, the party continues into a large entry hall, adorned with portraits of influential people. The most central tapestry shows a noble man in a silver armor labelled _Lord Argynvost_. Exploring the many doors leading away from the central hall, the party finds the ruined south wing inhabited with spider and decides to leave them to their business. Through the eastern doors the party enters a large dining hall with many chairs around a single, long table and surrounded by two statues clad in dragon-adorned armor. The next room resembles a chapel; through a broken window a dense fog flows into the room, obscuring the far side of the room. The party can only make out the shapes of three armored warriors. After Reese dissipates the fog, the warriors turn, demand of the party to leave. As the party again declines to leave, the warriors engage in combat.
