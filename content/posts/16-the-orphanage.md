## The Orphanage

As the party enquires at the Orphanage for Milivos, Claudia Blasko opens the door and informs them that he has suddenly fallen very sick, but lets the party in to attempt to help him.
As Thaddeus investigates the boy, he realizes that the medicine known to him (i.e., glue, nails and boards) will be of no help to Milivos. He then sends Claudia Blasko to get Father Petrovich, hoping he may be able to help.

While looking around the orphanage, the party saw that most children seemed healthy, with some having small bruises. Ilizeiros and Yaroslav searched the building and talked to the different children. They eventually decide to hunt down a girl's notebook hidden in a bedroom, hoping it would contain valuable information[^1].

At the same time, Reese found a strange boy in the attic, who other children said was trouble. As he approaches the boy named **Felix**, a ghostly entity reveals itself possessing the boy and attacks. The fight spans across several floors of the building. The party fights wildly against the ghost and finally destroys it. After that, Felix appared to come to his senses; also Milivos conditions quickly starts improving.
