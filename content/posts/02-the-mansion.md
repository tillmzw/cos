## The Second Floor

As the party ascends to the second story floor boards creaking, they find a large family portrait hanging at the far side of the hallway. On it, Rose and Thorn are accompanied by their parents [Gustav]({{< ref "gustav-durst" >}}) and [Elizabeth]({{< ref "elizabeth-durst" >}}) - the latter holding a baby, her eyes *scorning* the child. 

Along the walls, an inconspicuous door and two sets of double doors can be seen, the latter framed by decorative armor stands. Behind one of them, [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) notices shades moving and enters a room that is furnished chandeliers, luxurious upholstery, multiple joyful paintings and various instruments. Benjamin follows a faint whimpering and finds a frizzled and starved dog, keeping a cautious distance from the visitors. Despite leading it to the food downstairs, the dog rejects any food from the table on the first floor. Someone finds that it is wearing a tag on its collar: its name is **Lancelot**.

[Ilzeiros]({{< ref "ilzeiros" >}}) attempts to reuse more furnishings, and finds together with [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) that one could salvage the decorative armor stand to fashion makeshift armor. Given the uncomfortable aura, they decide to press on instead.

The other door leads into a large study, furnished with a massive mahogany desk, another fireplace adorned by a large painting showing a windmill on a hill. Bookshelves take up a large part of the room, giving the study an air of a library. [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) finds a letter kit and two keys in the desk drawers. In the meantime, [Ilzeiros]({{< ref "ilzeiros" >}}) and [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) attempt to study some books of the hundreds in the shelves, but all crumble to dust when attempting to read them.

The small door leads into a servants quarter, housing two simple beds and access to the shaft of the dumbwaiter, leading into the kitchen on the ground floor and another room on the third floor. [Ilzeiros]({{< ref "ilzeiros" >}}) presses a button next to the dumbwaiter and a buzzer in the kitchen becomes audible.

Using one of the keys, [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) unlocks the cabinet on the ground floor and finds three different crossbows and distributes them among the party. [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) does not take his eyes off the stuffed wolves in the room, but everyone leaves the room unbothered.

On closer inspection of the windows and doors, it appears that all of them are bricked up - and do not allow any escape from the house. 

## The Topmost Floor

Having checked on all the doors on the second floor, the party takes the stairs to the third floor, noticing the quickly deteriorating condition of the floorings and other woodwork.  The lack of light and large quantities of dust hint at a completely abandoned part of the house; [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) leads with a lantern into the hallway. Suddenly, he is attacked by an armor stand, which is trying to throw him down the staircase. Having narrowly escaped the grappling attempt, [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) manages to blow the armors helmet off, and [Ilzeiros]({{< ref "ilzeiros" >}}) splits the armor apart lengthwise. Nothing is inside the destroyed armor.

In a room adjacent to the hallway, the party encounters Margret - a woman, looking in her thirties, introduces herself as the nurse maid. Disturbingly, she is a bodyless spectral apparition. Apparently unaware of her circumstances, she thanks the party for helping Rose and Thorn, but seems very preoccupied with taking care of Walther. As [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) finds out soon after, Margrets spectral self is preoccupied with cradling an empty crib.
When asked about the basement, Margrets smile fades and she murmurs about everything being "Elizabeth's fault". When asked about the date by [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}), Margret gives a year 400 years ago. She also says that the children Rose and Thorn should be in their bedroom in the attic by now.

Sometime after encountering the animated armor and Margret, both [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) and [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) notice a weird sensation, accompanied by a flashback of themselves eating maggot-infested food in the dining room.

## The Attic

Climbing the staircase to the attic and using the second key found before, the party finds the children's room. Draped in cobwebs, two children's beds stand on the side of the room, and in the middle of the room lie two skeletons, matching the beds in size. Two ghosts appear, bearing the familiar features of Thorn and Rose. As they glimpse upon their bodies, they seem to remember their predicament and explain: their parents had locked them in the attic and went into the basement (as they often did) - but they never returned, leaving them to starve in their bedroom. Curiously, the nursemaid also never came looking for them. Rose tells of some scary monster in the basement, and that [Elizabeth]({{< ref "elizabeth-durst" >}}) took Walther into the basement. The last thing they heard outside of their room were loud screams followed by silence. Worryingly, it seems that there were other adventurers here before the party.

In the corner of the room there is a doll house, looking like an exact replica of the house. Following the plans, the party finds a separate, hidden staircase, leading from the attic down into a basement. There also appears to be a hidden room next to the study. In the room adjacent to the children's room, the party enters the parent's bedroom. A man, half rotten, half skeleton hangs from a noose; beside him, there is a letter signed by [Gustav]({{< ref "gustav-durst" >}}) and addressed to his children. He writes about survival turned to obsession and about him and [Elizabeth]({{< ref "elizabeth-durst" >}}) being punished, making their children suffer for it.
Another letter from [Elizabeth]({{< ref "elizabeth-durst" >}}), addressed to [Ms. Pedrovna]({{< ref "ms-pedrovna" >}}), talks about an *unwanted fiend* and an *innocent sacrifice, but not truly innocent* and *without attendance of [Gustav]({{< ref "gustav-durst" >}})*. Margret later confirms that Ms Pedrovna and her husband Peter are regular visitors.
Having seen the hidden room on the doll house, [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) is able to find the opening mechanism to the room. In the shelves here various tomes about fiend summoning by the Priests of Ozibus are found. On a wall, a heavy iron chest stands half-opened, with a skeleton's lower body hanging out of it. Upon carefully opening the chest, it becomes clear that the person was killed by a trap mechanism shooting poison darts. In the chest, there are blank books with black leather covers, three spell scrolls, the deed to the Durst windmill and a letter by [Strahd of Zarovich]({{< ref "strahd-of-zarovich" >}}).

Inspecting the books sheds some light on the family's history. Apparently, the Durst family was a well established merchant family, earning their wealth by milling and trading wheat. Their fortune collapsed together with the local agriculture sector, soon after [Strahd of Zarovich]({{< ref "strahd-of-zarovich" >}}) took control of the region and areas became perpetually shrouded. Famines were so great that nobles resorted to cannibalize travellers during rituals - among these proponents was [Elizabeth Durst]({{< ref "elizabeth-durst" >}}).

Another bedroom in the attic holds another skeleton stuffed in a wooden trunk, wearing the same style of clothing as the nursemaid Margret. Her death was caused by blunt trauma and a cut to the neck so deep the scratch can be seen on her spine.

Finally, the party approaches the hidden staircase leading to the basement. After descending the long staircase, the party finds branching tunnels, dug out from the ground under the mansion.
