## Doru

In the church's basement, Reese gets jumped from behind by a creature hidden in a dark corner. Wounded - and apparently drained - by the creature, Reese almost succumbs, but gets patched up by Thaddeus, just enough to stand by himself. Meanwhile, Ilizeiros and Benjamin attack the creature and force it to retreat with wounds glowing by Benjamin's attacks. 

A quick-witted Reese throws his oil lamp on the stone stairs, leading out of the basement and detects the creature hanging on the ceiling over the stairs. By now, everyone realized this creature is Father Donavich's son, Doru, who has been terribly transformed into a vampiric being, reduced to his obsession with flesh and blood of the living. Although Doru attempts to hide on the graveyard, the party manages to kill him for good. 
As Father Donavich realizes his son's final fate, he starts grieving dearly. Ilizeiros however quickly interrupts him forcefully and insists on questioning him. Father Donavich reveals he took only people that had "no souls" and thus appeared "empty", and whose lives thus were doomed anyway. Additionally, he recalls that Doru returned changed from an uprising against Lord Strahd; all other involved villagers were never seen again, including a might wizard, whose fight with Lord Strahd devastated swaths of Mount Gakis. He pleads to not be involved in the disappearance of Mad Mary's daughter, Gertrude.

Father Donavich performs last rites for his son, and Ilizeiros prevents him present-mindedly from hanging himself after, by taking him to the burgomaster for proper justice. There he confesses to his crimes and is consequently swiftly sentenced to death by the blade. Ismark is not willing to do the deed, Ilizeiros however is quick to jump in - but takes two gruesome swings to end Father Donavich's life. A large raven watches the execution form a rooftop and flies off after.
Deciding to rest in the tavern, Benjamin keeps a close eye the whole night on Reese, as he is suspicious of his condition after the encounter with Doru. Around midnight, he witnesses a strange spectacle: dozens of ghosts, clad in adventuring gear, rise from the graveyard and walk towards Castle Ravenloft.
After the night, the party buys up all of the few rations available at the tavern and notices that the innkeep feels... *empty*. Starting the journey to Vallaki with Ireena, the group travels southwards and encounters a group of trappers in the forests. Undisturbed by them, they continue their journey to the Vistani camp, where the fortune teller Eva is to be found.

On a road crossing, Benjamin abruptly turns towards a gallows pole on the wayside behind him, and sees a body hanging there. As the body slowly turns in the wind, he realizes that it wears his face. Shocked by the impression, he turns towards the rest of the party, but no one else can see a body...
As they arrive in a Vistani camp consisting of five colorful tents, they get helpfully directed to a large tent in the camp, on a lake side. Inside, the familar face frmo everyone's dreams approaches - Madam Eva.
