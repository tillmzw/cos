## Doru

In the church's basement, Reese gets jumped from behind by a creature hidden in a dark corner. Wounded - and apparently drained - by the creature, Reese almost succumbs, but gets patched up by Thaddeus, just enough to stand by himself. Meanwhile, Ilizeiros and Benjamin attack the creature and force it to retreat with wounds glowing by Benjamin's attacks. 

A quick-witted Reese throws his oil lamp on the stone stairs, leading out of the basement and detects the creature hanging on the ceiling over the stairs. By now, everyone realized this creature is Father Donavich's son, Doru, who has been terribly transformed into a vampiric being, reduced to his obsession with flesh and blood of the living. Although Doru attempts to hide on the graveyard, the party manages to kill him for good. 
As Father Donavich realizes his son's final fate, he starts grieving dearly. Ilizeiros however quickly interrupts him forcefully and insists on questioning him. Father Donavich reveals he took only people that had "no souls" and thus appeared "empty", and whose lives thus were doomed anyway. Additionally, he recalls that Doru returned changed from an uprising against Lord Strahd; all other involved villagers were never seen again, including a might wizard, whose fight with Lord Strahd devastated swaths of Mount Gakis. He pleads to not be involved in the disappearance of Mad Mary's daughter, Gertrude.

Father Donavich performs last rites for his son, and Ilizeiros prevents him present-mindedly from hanging himself after, by taking him to the burgomaster for proper justice. There he confesses to his crimes and is consequently swiftly sentenced to death by the blade. Ismark is not willing to do the deed, Ilizeiros however is quick to jump in - but takes two gruesome swings to end Father Donavich's life. A large raven watches the execution form a rooftop and flies off after.
Deciding to rest in the tavern, Benjamin keeps a close eye the whole night on Reese, as he is suspicious of his condition after the encounter with Doru. Around midnight, he witnesses a strange spectacle: dozens of ghosts, clad in adventuring gear, rise from the graveyard and walk towards Castle Ravenloft.
After the night, the party buys up all of the few rations available at the tavern and notices that the innkeep feels... *empty*. Starting the journey to Vallaki with Ireena, the group travels southwards and encounters a group of trappers in the forests. Undisturbed by them, they continue their journey to the Vistani camp, where the fortune teller Eva is to be found.

On a road crossing, Benjamin abruptly turns towards a gallows pole on the wayside behind him, and sees a body hanging there. As the body slowly turns in the wind, he realizes that it wears his face. Shocked by the impression, he turns towards the rest of the party, but no one else can see a body...
As they arrive in a Vistani camp consisting of five colorful tents, they get helpfully directed to a large tent in the camp, on a lake side. Inside, the familar face frmo everyone's dreams approaches - Madam Eva.

## Fate unveiled

Madam Eva presses to reveal the adventurers *destiny* using her deck of Taroka cards and places the first card down. 

> *This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy.*

She flips it over to reveal the three of coins, the **trader**, and goes on: 

> *I see the best merchants in all the land! But they are the victims of a great theft! Stop the thieves, retrieve what was stolen, and the merchants shall reward you dearly.*

She places the second card down.

> *This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope.*

She flips it over to reveal the six of coins, the **beggar** and continues.

> *How far a mighty dragon can fall! He is barely a memory, but he begs your help! Find him in his home and help him reignite his light and he will reward you with protection from the devil.*

She places the third card down.

> *This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight.*

She flips it over to reveal the three of swords, the **soldier** and adds:

> *I see those that once stood up against the darkness. Warriors of mind and magic! But alas, only one remains. Find this warrior - this warrior without name - in a great amber crypt.*

Madam Eva pauses for a second and takes a smaller deck of cards. She puts the first one at the bottom to complete the form of a cross.

> *This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness. A lone Vistana roams the land. She stays in no one place for long, but catch her, and her fierce will shall aid you greatly! Find her in a town far to the west, well hidden behind the walls of man.*

She draws the last card and puts it in the middle of the other four. 

> *Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!*

She flips it over to unveal the **innocent** and says:

> *When it is time to face your fate in the eyes of your deadliest foe, pursue him into the depth of darkness! You shall find the devil in the tomb of the only man he has ever envied.*
