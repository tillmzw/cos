## The Reading

Madam Eva places the first card down "This card tells of history. Knowledge of the ancient will help you better understand your enemy". She flips it over to reveal the three of coins, the trader, and goes on: "I see the best merchants in all the land! But they are the victims of a great theft! Stop the thieves, retrieve what was stolen, and the merchants shall reward you dearly."

She places the second card down "This card tells of a powerful force for good and protection, a holy symbol of great hope". She flips it over to reveal the six of coins, the beggar and continues "How far a mighty dragon can fall! He is barely a memory, but he begs your help! Find him in his home and help him reignite his light and he will reward you with protection from the devil."

She places the third card down "This is a card of power and strength. It tells of a weapon of vengeance: a sword of sunlight". She flips it over to reveal the three of swords, the soldier and says "I see those that once stood up against the darkness. Warriors of mind and magic! But alas, only one remains. Find this warrior - this warrior without name - in a great amber crypt."

Madam Eva pauses for a second and takes a smaller deck of cards. She puts the first one at the bottom to complete the form of a cross "This card sheds light on one who will help you greatly in the battle against darkness "A lone Vistana roams the land. She stays in no one place for long, but catch her, and her fierce will shall aid you greatly! Find her in a town far to the west, well hidden behind the walls of man."

She draws the last card and puts it in the middle of the other four. "Your enemy is a creature of darkness, whose powers are beyond mortality. This card will lead you to him!". She flips it over to unveal the innocent and says "When it is time to face your fate in the eyes of your deadliest foe, pursue him into the depth of darkness! You shall find the devil in the tomb of the only man he has ever envied".
