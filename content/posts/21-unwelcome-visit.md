## The Gate

While attempting to rest after a long day (which included a fight against werewolves), an interesting meeting with the local abbot, the party finds a quiet place somewhere in the walled area that is Krezk. Before everyone can get their earned night's rest, knocks on the city gates can be heard - way too loud to be made by a regular humans hands.

Upon climbing the gatehouse in the foggy night, the *thing* that knocks remains unrecognizable but keeps on banging on the gate. Smaller claws can be heard all around the floor in front of the gate.
Suddenly, an ominous voice can be heard from outside the walls, hard to place to a specific place. After a brief introduction it becomes clear that the voice belongs to one Anastrasya Karelova - one of Strahd's brides. She is asking for a *doll* that is hidden within the walls; it soon becomes clear that the means Ireena. Thinking her safe at the abby, the party blabs and lets Anastrasya know that Ireena is in fact at the abby. After confirming her suspicions, Anastrasyas voice disappears.

In an attempt to defend the gate, the party blasts blindly towards the area in front of the gate, hears some squealing but ultimately can't stop the large *thing* to break down the gate for good. It walks in a straight line to the center of Krezk - presumably to the burgomasters mansion. Before it gets there, the party manages to kill it and makes note of its humanoid but deranged bodily features.

Immediately, the party rushes back towards the abby to seek advise from the abbot and make sure Ireena is safe.

## The Abby

Passing the sleeping animalistic guards, the party rushes back and splits up: Thaddeus and Yaroslav confront the abbot to find out more about Anastrasya and his idea of palm off a semi-sentient doll on Strahd. At the same time, Ilizeiros and Reese rush back to the library to find Ezmeralda and Ireena. As the two arrive, they find the face matching the voice heard before: Anastrasya has found Ireena and is making it known that she intends to depart with her, willing or not.
