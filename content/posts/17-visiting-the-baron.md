## Leaving the Orphanage
In the aftermath of the battle with the shadowy creature, the party realizes that there was an unfortunate casualty - a baby died in the nursery. Since there are no visible wounds on the body, Thaddeus gives up hope of helping it. Talking to Claudia Blasko, she is taken aback by the fight's consequences but goes back to keeping order and calm in the orphanage. Regarding Felix, she mentions another boy died in unknown circumstances and hands the party a locket, emanating with the same necromantic aura that surrounded Felix before. Ilizeiros puts it in his pocket.

On the way following Ireena to the Baron's estate, the party goes for lunch; Yaroslav warns of Boninka's pies, since he feels people forget their past troubles eating them. Thaddeus is too tempted and tries a bite, immediately feeling the warm feeling of delicious fullness; Yaroslav and Ilizeiros on the other hand buy a bowl of root soup from a street vendor.

## Ireena and Izak
Approaching the Baron's estate, Thaddeus and Ilizeiros announce themselves and are led to a waiting room. Yaroslav - not being in a presentable state with his wounds and general attire - roams around the house in the garden and inspects the place.

With Ireena nowhere to be seen, Thaddeus starts hearing thumping from above; sneaking through the house to investigate, he and Ilizeiros eventually find Ireena tied and locked up in a room full of dolls in her likeness. They free her, overhearing a nearby conversation between the Baron and his wife with Father Petrovich (apparently the Baron's wife's brother), who pleads to shelter the refugees. Yaroslav meanwhile looks for a way to sneak and climb into the house to link up again with the rest.

As Ilizeiros and Thaddeus, Ireena in tow, quietly attempt to leave, they hear Izak approach from the only known escape route. Thaddeus opens a door to a different dimension, resembling a dusty attic with a few old children's toys strewn about. Able to escape detection in that extra-dimensional attic, Izak can be seen frantically searching for Ireena. She explains meanwhile that Izak bound her, saying he dreamt of her and needs her, "to save Barovia".

With Izak treading through the hallways, the Baron eventually concludes his audience with Father Petrovich and leaves with him, his wife and two large guard dogs. The Baron repeatedly asks Izak what the fuss is about, but doesn't appear to get an answer. Yaroslav miraculously manages to sneak around the Baron and his entourage, finds his way to the attic. After waiting a few more minutes until the coast is clear, they manage to escape through a window Yaroslav used to enter the building. Before heading back to the Church, where Ireena claims she will be safe, Thaddeus asks her to disguise herself by means of one of his potions.

With Ireena looking like a commoner resembling Mad Mary, the party makes their way to the Church, where they finally encounter Father Petrovich.
