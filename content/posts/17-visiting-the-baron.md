## Leaving the Orphanage
In the aftermath of the battle with the shadowy creature, the party realizes that there was an unfortunate casualty - a baby died in the nursery. Since there are no visible wounds on the body, {{% mdref thaddeus %}} gives up hope of helping it. Talking to {{% mdref claudia-blasko %}}, she is taken aback by the fight's consequences but goes back to keeping order and calm in the orphanage. Regarding Felix, she mentions another boy died in unknown circumstances and hands the party a locket, emanating with the same necromantic aura that surrounded Felix before. {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} puts it in his pocket.

On the way following {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}} to the Baron's estate, the party goes for lunch; {{% mdref yaroslav %}} warns of Boninka's pies, since he feels people forget their past troubles eating them. {{% mdref thaddeus %}} is too tempted and tries a bite, immediately feeling the warm feeling of delicious fullness; {{% mdref yaroslav %}} and {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} on the other hand buy a bowl of root soup from a street vendor.

## Ireena and Izek
Approaching the Baron's estate, {{% mdref thaddeus %}} and {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} announce themselves and are led to a waiting room. {{% mdref yaroslav %}} - not being in a presentable state with his wounds and general attire - roams around the house in the garden and inspects the place.

With {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}} nowhere to be seen, {{% mdref thaddeus %}} starts hearing thumping from above; sneaking through the house to investigate, he and {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} eventually find {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}} tied and locked up in a room full of dolls in her likeness. They free her, overhearing a nearby conversation between the Baron and his wife with {{% mdref father-petrovich %}} (apparently the Baron's wife's brother), who pleads to shelter the refugees. {{% mdref yaroslav %}} meanwhile looks for a way to sneak and climb into the house to link up again with the rest.

As {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} and {{% mdref thaddeus %}}, {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}} in tow, quietly attempt to leave, they hear {{% mdref izek %}} approach from the only known escape route. {{% mdref thaddeus %}} opens a door to a different dimension, resembling a dusty attic with a few old children's toys strewn about. Able to escape detection in that extra-dimensional attic, {{% mdref izek %}} can be seen frantically searching for {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}}. She explains meanwhile that {{% mdref izek %}} bound her, saying he dreamt of her and needs her, "to save Barovia".

With {{% mdref izek %}} treading through the hallways, the Baron eventually concludes his audience with {{% mdref father-petrovich %}} and leaves with him, his wife and two large guard dogs. The Baron repeatedly asks {{% mdref izek %}} what the fuss is about, but doesn't appear to get an answer. {{% mdref yaroslav %}} miraculously manages to sneak around the Baron and his entourage, finds his way to the attic. After waiting a few more minutes until the coast is clear, they manage to escape through a window {{% mdref yaroslav %}} used to enter the building. Before heading back to the Church, where {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}} claims she will be safe, {{% mdref thaddeus %}} asks her to disguise herself by means of one of his potions.

With {{% mdref ireena-kolyana Ireena %}} looking like a commoner resembling Mad Mary, the party makes their way to the Church, where they finally encounter {{% mdref father-petrovich %}}.
