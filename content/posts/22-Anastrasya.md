# The situation

The party is split. {{% mdref Reese %}} and {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} confront Anastrasya at the library. {{% mdref Thaddeus %}} and {{% mdref yaroslav %}} talk to the abbot at the abbey.

# The Fight against Anastrasya

Anastrasya, {{% mdref ireena-kolyana %}} and Otto the guard are waiting for the adventurers in the library. Ezmeralda arrives with them. Anastrasya somehow seems to control Otto to do her bidding although its unclear to them how. Even Ireena slapping him doesn't get him out of her influence. 

At the high ceiling of the library, bats assemble.

After some banter, a fight ensues. Reese, Ezmeralda and Ilizeiros get some hits in. But overall Anastrasya is too strong for them.

# The conversation with Abbs

Meanwhile: In the conversation between {{% mdref Thaddeus %}}, {{% mdref yaroslav %}} and "Abbs" there is a lot of back and forth. They learn things about vampires in general and Anastrasya.

- Abbs doesn't consider Strahd or Anastrasya evil. Just misguided.
- Vampires are vulnerable to Radiant magic, holy water and stakes (only when they're in a coffin regenerating)
- Anastrasya might be jealous of Ireena.

The two leave Abbs driven by some instict that their friends might be in trouble and run towards the library. On the way they pass a disturbing 2-headed musician. On of his heads is the head of a baby.

# Strahd himself appears

As Anastrasya appears to win the fight,  {{% mdref Esmeralda %}} flees and tells them she will get some holy water. At the same time more and more bats appear in the high cealing through the windows. As they have grown to a large swarm, they descend and surround Ireena. The man himself - {{% strahd-of-zarovich %}}  - appears out of them.

He tells Anastrasya: "This is not your place!". Anastrasya tries to strike Ireena. Strahd casually rips her arm out. She flees.

Otto attacks Strahd and gets killed for his folly.

Strahd addresses {{% mdref ireena-kolyana %}} as "Tatyana". Apparently he confuses her for his long-lost love. He tells her "Only i can protect you". She is not convinced.

{{% mdref Thaddeus %}} and {{% mdref yaroslav %}} arrrive - the party reunites facing Strahd.

- Strahd admires Thaddeus' craft
- Yaroslav is stunned.
- Strahd tells Reese he might need Reeses help with something.
- His sword wants {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} to do something. He resists. For now.

Strahd invites the entire party to his castle, Castle Ravenloft and then disappears.

# What now?

The party sleeps, collects holy water and discusses what to do next. They contact Ezmeralda telepathically.

She tells them to meet her at the tower on lake Baratok. As they are on their way, they get confronted on a bridge in the fog by a dark rider...
