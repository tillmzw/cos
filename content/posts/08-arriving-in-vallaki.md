## Gates of Vallaki

Having arrived at the gates of Vallaki, {{% mdref thaddeus %}}, {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} and {{% mdref vasily-van-holt %}} approach the gate, propping {{% mdref reese %}} and {{% mdref benjamin %}} up. While these two still suffer from the consequences of the wolf encounter a few hours ago, the guards hiding behind the massive gate question the arrivals from the wilderness. As it turns out, the two guards are wary of supporters of {{% mdref strahd-of-zarovich Strahd %}}, whose name is not to be used within {{% mdref vallaki %}}s city walls - the name the locals use for the land's lord is simply *the Devil*. Furthermore, usage of magic and weapons inside the city is not appreciated, but carrying weapons is tolerated for the purpose of self defense against the dangers of the land around {{% mdref vallaki %}}. After {{% mdref vasily-van-holt %}} vouches for the party, the guards (who, by now, have introduced themselves as Bruno and Clemens) have one last important information before entry is granted: the weekly festival in {{% mdref Vallaki %}} is mandatory to attend, with the purpose of keeping the spirits up in the city. 

## Inside the City

Following the directions given by the guards to the **Blue Water Inn**, {{% mdref reese %}} and {{% mdref benjamin %}} get given some time to rest and heal their wounds. Walking the streets, it becomes obvious that the people of Vallaki seem happier than the people of the village of Barovia.

Meanwhile {{% mdref ilizeiros %}} and {{% mdref thaddeus %}} escort {{% mdref ireena-kolyana %}} to her destination: a massive, stone church in the center of {{% mdref vallaki %}}. In there, she approaches **Father Lucian Petrovich** and asks for help in finding a new priest for the {{% mdref barovia "village of Barovia" %}}. Unfortunately, there is none available currently; {{% mdref ireena-kolyana %}} finds shelter at the church, and will meet back up with the party in the three days time for the upcoming *festival of the Blazing Sun*.

{{% mdref ilizeiros %}} and {{% mdref thaddeus %}} return the stockyard the passed previously. There, they buy new armor at the general store, check the stock at *Stefanovich & Sons", an apothecary, and finally return to the inn. 

{{% mdref benjamin %}} has since been given more intensive care for his wounds at the inn, while {{% mdref reese %}} was sleeping soundly after having had a single glass of wine.

## Wizards of the Wine

The next morning, the party enquires about the festivals in {{% mdref vallaki %}} at the innkeep. He explains that the recurring festivals simply serve to keep the spirits up, so that {{% mdref vallaki %}} can remain untouched by *the Devil*. During the next festival of *the blazing sun*, a wicker sun is to be set ablaze, accompanied by processions and a speech by the local burgomaster **Baron Vargas Vallakovich** (from a long list of burgomasters from this family). It turns out that wine plays an important role, however the last shipments have not arrived. Coincidentally, the innkeep **Urvin Martikov** belongs to the family that runs the winery to the west, the famous *Wizards of the Wine*. Looking for work and understanding of the local situation, the party agrees to get to the bottom of the missing shipments. After **Urvin** draws a rough map of the path to the winery, the party gets on its way.

Travelling is mostly uneventful, except from {{% mdref thaddeus %}} killing a raven with a stone since he is concerned with the murder of crows following the party. Arriving at the winery, the party encounters a group of small people that turn out to be workers from the winery. They report that this very morning the vineyard was overrun by druids and the most workers just about made it out before they arrived. Among the people are **Adrian**, **Stefania** and the aged **Davian Martikov**, the owner of the vineyard. 

Accompanied by **Adrian** and **Stefania** the party approaches the large central vineyard building through the vines in an attempt to stay hidden; a short distance away from the house, a rustling around them betrays a large group of twig creatures quickly encroaching from behind and the sides. The group decides to make speed to the loading dock of the winery. While {{% mdref reese %}} frees a cargo wagon loaded with wine (which rolls over a single twig creature and comes to a stand still some distance away), {{% mdref thaddeus %}} frees a rope from the cargo lift and the group climbs up and narrowly escapes the horde of twigs.
