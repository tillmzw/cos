## Burning horse

The party moves to the druid hill. From afar they see a dark rider passing by they can't recognize on a dark burning horse. The group recognizes the horse from a toy. Its Beucephalus. The demon horse. The rider passes from view.

There is a large thunderstorm going on. Lightning is flashing every few seconds.

## Blood druid

The hill is covered by cairns. On the top there is a stone wall ring and a very large wooden statue. A few hundred feet further back there is a giant tree and the party hears chanting originating from there.

An blooddruid is standing in the middle of the stone wall ring holding the Stefania captive and is apparently trying to get her power. He is covered in dried blood, wears no clothes and is mad. The group attacks him. 

He proves to be a formidable enemy, summoning walls of vines protecting himself and a captured Stefania.

At the same time the group notices a spear sticking out from the statue. They try to get the spear out of the statue which they succeed at after some trouble. Benjamin picks up the spear. Its enchanted and cursed and talks to Benjamin.

After some further trouble they manage to kill the blood druid. 

## Interrupting a ritual

The groups seems to have been just a little bit too late. The subteranian veins that pulsate from the tree to the statue stop pulsating.

The chantinh stops.

The statue crumbles.

The lightning stops.

A giant walking treefolk emerges and starts walking in the direction of the vinejard.

## The ritualists attack

The group is hurt badly from the fight and decides not to try to stop the treefolk. There is another problem however.

A large group of people are moving from the tree to the stone circle where the group is trying to recover. 

The party tries to ambush the group of a dozen druids and berserkers moving to the stone circle at the entrance to the hilltop.

A large battle ensues.

The party manages to kill many of the attacker, summoning dark magic swallowing the battlefield and turning some of the group against each other.

In the end however it is too much.

Benjamin dies valiantly fighting in the frontline.
