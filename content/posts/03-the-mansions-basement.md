## The Basement

The circular staircase descends into the earth beneath the Durst Mansion to reveal a tunnel system carved out of earth, clay, and rock. The narrow tunnels are supported with timber braces and the rooms are held up by thick wooden posts with crossbeams and the whole basement is filled with an ininteligable murmuring.

At the bottom of the stairs two paths lead off, one to the left and right. The party follows the left path and walks past a tunnel revealing half open stone slab doors. The tunnel turns and small stairs lead down to a larger room with a table and multiple alcoves fitted with straw beds. The room looks like it has not been used in decades as a thick layer of dust covers the floors. 

Another set of stairs leads further down to reveal another room with a well in the middle and five adjacent rooms, each bearing a bed and a chest. A snarl in one of the rooms alerts the party to two humanoid figures with elongated limbs and rotting flesh. [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) and [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) get ready to face the figures as [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) connects to the mind of one of the figures and reaches out to it, in vain. The figure turns abruptley and lunges towards the party. As [Ilzeiros]({{< ref "ilzeiros" >}}) manages to slay one of the creatures and [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) struggles to hold his ground, a third creature comes up from the well and pulls [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) down into it. The creature coming for [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) manages to fell him even after getting both arms blown off. While [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) administers first aid to [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}), [Ilzeiros]({{< ref "ilzeiros" >}}) and [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) finish off the last standing creature in the well.

The chests hold a silvered shortsword, some coin and different smaller objects of value, and the party decides to rest in these rooms. During [Benjamins]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) watch strange noises of footstep disturb the parties sleep, but no further sound is heard.
