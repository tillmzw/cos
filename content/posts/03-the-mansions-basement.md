## The Basement

The circular staircase descends into the earth beneath the Durst Mansion to reveal a tunnel system carved out of earth, clay, and rock. The narrow tunnels are supported with timber braces and the rooms are held up by thick wooden posts with crossbeams and the whole basement is filled with an ininteligable murmuring.

At the bottom of the stairs two paths lead off, one to the left and right. The party follows the left path and walks past a tunnel revealing half open stone slab doors. The tunnel turns and small stairs lead down to a larger room with a table and multiple alcoves fitted with straw beds. The room looks like it has not been used in decades as a thick layer of dust covers the floors. 

Another set of stairs leads further down to reveal another room with a well in the middle and five adjacent rooms, each bearing a bed and a chest. A snarl in one of the rooms alerts the party to two humanoid figures with elongated limbs and rotting flesh. [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) and [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) get ready to face the figures as [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) connects to the mind of one of the figures and reaches out to it, in vain. The figure turns abruptley and lunges towards the party. As [Ilzeiros]({{< ref "ilzeiros" >}}) manages to slay one of the creatures and [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) struggles to hold his ground, a third creature comes up from the well and pulls [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) down into it. The creature coming for [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) manages to fell him even after getting both arms blown off. While [Thaddeus]({{< ref "thaddeus" >}}) administers first aid to [Benjamin]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}), [Ilzeiros]({{< ref "ilzeiros" >}}) and [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) finish off the last standing creature in the well.

After the fight everyone takes time to tend to their wounds and explore the rest of the room. The chests hold a silvered shortsword, some coin and different smaller objects of value, and the party decides to rest in these rooms. During [Benjamins]({{< ref "benjamin" >}}) watch strange noises of footstep disturb the parties sleep, but no further sound is heard and the rest continues uninterrupted therafter.

Having regained some of their energy the party continues further into the basement. At the next fork in the path they take a right turn and come upon a staircase that leads them further down.

## The Reliquary

Coming down the stairs, the murmuring gets louder and becomes intelligable. It sounds like a dozen voices repeating "He is the ancient, He is the land ..." over and over again. At the bottom of the stairs the room widens into a large chamber with columns holding up the ceiling. Shelves along the walls hold a plethora of strange and mysterious objects:
• A vial of coagulated blood
• A lock of auburn hair, woven into a figure eight
• A shriveled severed finger
• A sun symbol made from woven wicker
• A patch of dried human skin
• A vial of murky swamp water
• The severed claw of a raven
• A black twig with blood-red thorns
• A dragon’s tooth wrapped in silver wire
• The tattered remains of a large bird feather
• A shard of amber
• A dried bouquet of wolf’s bane
• The desiccated ear of an elf

[Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) reaches out with his arcane senses to see if any of the objects are magical and then takes the shriveled finger and the shard of amber. Unbeknownst to the rest of the party, [Reese]({{< ref "reese" >}}) also realizes, that the cards each of them had revieved, are pulsing with magical energy. The party continues in the direction of the chanting.
