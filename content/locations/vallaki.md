Vallaki is surrounded by fortified pallisades, adorned with wolves heads.

The populace is markedly more content than all other inhabitants of {{% mdref Barovia %}} and defies {{% mdref strahd-of-zarovich %}} whom it calls "*the Devil*". Apparently, their morale is boosted through a weekly festival whose attendance is mandatory.
